    <p>With a Bachelors and Masters degree in Architecture from Yeditepe University, 
    I have a deep understanding of architectural design, complemented by my experience as a 
    teaching assistant and lecturer.</p> 
    <p></p>I am pursuing an MSc in Connected Environments at University College 
    London (UCL), exploring cutting-edge technologies like sensor systems, AI, and digital spaces.
    <P></P>My research interests revolve around the intersection of architecture, technology, 
    and virtual environments, and I aim to contribute to innovative projects that redefine how we 
    interact with spaces in the 21st century. Outside of academics, I am an advocate for diversity and 
    inclusion and strive to create environments that are welcoming and supportive for everyone.</p>
